// The experiments package holds various experiments with NEAT.
//
// The XOR experiment serves to actually check that network topology actually evolves and everything works as expected.
// Because XOR is not linearly separable, a neural network requires hidden units to solve it. The two inputs must be
// combined at some hidden unit, as opposed to only at the out- put node, because there is no function over a linear
// combination of the inputs that can separate the inputs into the proper classes. These structural requirements make
// XOR suitable for testing NEATâ€™s ability to evolve structure.
